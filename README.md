### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hi. I am a 2nd year at the University of Waterloo, studying Statistics. I am proficient in full stack development with MERN Stack, but am flexible to work with with any software development. I love backend development, and always on the lookout for internships where I can work with senior engineers to learn and build cool products.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MERN stack apps
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Backend Development (Reading about Operating Systems and hoping to build one)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building various projects, internships are the most ideal, but do reachout to me for open source projects or hackathons.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting internships at big tech companies.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience of how my first internship made me love backend development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: v59shah@uwaterloo.ca
